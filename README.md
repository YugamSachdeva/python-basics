# Python Basics 🐍

This repository contains my Python learning journey.  
I created this repo to practice Python fundamentals, improve logic building, and work on basic DSA problems step by step.

All programs here are written while learning and revising concepts, so the code is simple, readable, and easy to understand.

## 🚀 What I have practiced
- Python data types and variables  
- Conditional statements (if–else)  
- Loops (for loop, while loop)  
- Lists, tuples, and sets  
- Dictionary operations  
- User-defined functions  
- Basic DSA problems (arrays, searching, logic)
