# Python Basics 🐍

This repository represents my Python learning journey.  
I created this repo to practice Python fundamentals, build logical thinking, and understand how core concepts work together.

All the programs here are written during learning and revision, keeping the code simple, clean, and easy to understand.

## 🚀 What I have practiced
- Python data types and variables  
- Input and output handling  
- Conditional statements (if–else)  
- Loops (for loop, while loop)  
- Lists, tuples, and sets  
- Dictionary operations  
- User-defined functions  
- Exception handling  
- Working with Python modules  
- Basic DSA problems (arrays, searching, logic)
